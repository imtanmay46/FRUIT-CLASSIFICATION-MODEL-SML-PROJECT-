FRUIT CLASSIFICATION MODEL USING MACHINE LEARNING & DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES

INTRODUCTION :->

Machine learning has become an increasingly popular approach to solving complex problems in a variety of fields. 
In this study, we explore the application of various machine learning techniques to classify and predict labels for a large and complex ’Fruit Classification’ dataset with over 4000 features.
The aim of the project is to identify underlying patterns in the data and predict the labels for a test dataset, which could have important implications for a range of applications in the agriculture and food industries.
We apply popular preprocessing techniques, including label encoding, dimen- sionality reduction, and outlier detection, to prepare the data for analysis. 
We then compare the performance of several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression and others, to evaluate their ability to predict the labels accurately.
Our results suggest that the Logistic Regression CV model with a ’newton-cg’ solver performs the best, achieving a k- fold cross-validation accuracy of approximately 82 percent on the validation set.

LITERATURE REVIEW :->

Machine learning and deep learning have gained popularity among scholars and computer science experts as they provide new insights into data analysis across various fields, such as image recognition, natural language processing, and healthcare. 
Recently, significant attention has been given to the use of machine learning techniques in agriculture and food industries, particularly in fruit classification, due to its potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of fruit sorting and grading systems.

Several well-known scholars have explored the use of machine learning techniques for fruit classification using different datasets and methodologies. 
For example, in a study by Li et al., a deep learning model was used to classify fruits based on images, achieving an accuracy of over 95 percent on a dataset of five fruit types.

In this project, various machine learning models were applied to a ”Fruit Classification” dataset with 4096 features. 
Prior to model training, preprocessing techniques were em- ployed, including dimensionality reduction using PCA and LDA, and outlier detection using LOF (Local Outlier Factor) scores. 
The aim of the project was to identify patterns in the data and predict labels for a test dataset, which could have implications for applications in the agriculture and food industries. 
Our study contributes to the existing literature by evaluating the performance of different machine learning models on a large and complex fruit classification dataset and comparing the results with those of previous studies conducted by well-known scholars in the field.
